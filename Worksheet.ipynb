    "Create a Python program either here in Jhub or using Spyder Locally.  Inside the main definition, the program begins by setting up the LocoRobo API (also known as Application Programming Interface; the LocoRobo API contains many helpful commands for interacting with the robot). Next, we scan for 2000 milliseconds using the Bluetooth dongle to find robots in the room. Then, we use the get_robot command (defined in an earlier section of your Python code - this will be covered in detail in a future lesson).\n",
